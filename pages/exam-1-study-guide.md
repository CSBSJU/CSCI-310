### Chapter 1
* The 7-layer architecture of a typical computer system along with a clear
  understanding of how abstraction plays a role in this architecture
* Major hardware components of a computer system
* Data and control flow in a computer system
* System software vs. applications software
* Operating systems and their functions

### Chapter 2
* Programming in C
* C procedures and functions (including recursion)
  * Call by reference vs. call by value
  * Memory allocation and deallocation processes
* C memory model: static memory, stack, and heap
* Dynamic memory allocation in C (pointers and data structures)

### Chapter 3
* Integers
  * Range (min, max) for an N-bit signed/unsigned number
  * Convert among all the numbering systems discussed (decimal, binary,
    hexadecimal, etc.)
  * 2's complement notation for signed numbers
  * Perform arithmetic/logical operations: **ADD**, **SUBTRACT**, **NEGATE**,
    **NOT**, **AND**, **OR**, **NOT**, **XOR**, <i class="icon-arrow-right"></i>
    (i.e. implies), etc.
  * Status bits (**N**, **Z**, **V**, **C**)
* Characters
  * Characters and their ASCII numeric codes **(ASCII TABLE WILL BE PROVIDED)**
* Data representation and compression for audio and image data
* Floating Point numbers
  * Design: sign, exponent, mantissa, excess value
  * Normalized, denormalized and special values
  * IEEE format for any N-bit floating-point number

### Sample questions
* Show memory (static memory, stack and heap) for a given C program (also find
  output)
* Converting among decimal, binary, and hexadecimal (signed and unsigned)
* Logical/arithmetic operations on signed integers and effects on NZVC
* The IEEE floating-point format (normalized, denormalized, and special values)
