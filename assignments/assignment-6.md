Pep/9 programs that do not adhere to the following WILL NOT be accepted or
graded:
* You are expected to do literal line-by-line translation. 
* Your assembly programs must include comments showing the corresponding C code
  that produces the each line of assembly code in your program. 
* In addition, I expect to see complete trace tags in your program (for global
  and stack tracers) such that I can see a complete picture of memory (static
  memory and stack) when using Pep/9's tracer.
* Finally, your program must be indented nicely to make it readable.

Solve the following problems

1. Chapter 6, problem 27
  * **NOTE** The condition `j < numItems - 1` can be restated as `j + 1 <
    numItems`

1. Chapter 6, problem 28

1. Chapter 6, problem 29

1. <del>Chapter 6, problem 34</del>
  * <del>**NOTE** You need to read and understand how `switch` statements are
    treated in assembly (pages 350--355). This illustrates their superiority
    over `if` statements.</del>
