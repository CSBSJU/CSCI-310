## Exam 1 study guide

* **Chapter 1**
   * The 7-layer architecture of a typical computer system along with a clear understanding of how abstraction plays a role in this architecture
   * Major hardware components of a computer system
   * Data and control flow in a computer system
   * System software vs. applications software
   * Operating systems and their functions

* **Chapter 2**
   * Programming in C
   * C procedures and functions (including recursion)
      * Call by reference vs. call by value
      * Memory allocation and deallocation processes
   * C memory model: static memory, stack, and heap
   * Dynamic memory allocation in C (pointers and data structures)

* **Chapter 3**
   * Integers
      * Range (min, max) for an N-bit signed/unsigned number
      * Convert among all the numbering systems discussed (decimal, binary, hexadecimal, etc.)
      * 2's complement notation for signed numbers
      * Perform arithmetic/logical operations: **ADD**, **SUBTRACT**, **NEGATE**, **NOT**, **AND**, **OR**, **NOT**, **XOR**, <span class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></span> (i.e. implies), etc.
      * Status bits (**N**, **Z**, **V**, **C**)
   * Characters
      * Characters and their ASCII numeric codes **(ASCII TABLE WILL BE PROVIDED)**
   * Data representation and compression for audio and image data
   * Floating Point numbers (design (sign, exponent, mantissa, excess value) normalized, denormalized and special values)
      * IEEE format for any N-bit floating-point number

* **Chapter 4**
   * Pep/9 CPU and memory architecture
   * Pep/9 Instruction format
   * Pep/9 Instructions **(INSTRUCTION TABLE WILL BE PROVIDED)**
      * Operand vs. operand specifier
      * Unary vs. non-unary instruction
      * Byte vs. word operations
      * RTL specification for instructions
      * Effects on CPU, NZVC, and memory
   * Von Neumann Architecture
      * Memory holds both program and data
      * Sequence of steps in the von Neumann cycle
      * Be able to trace the effects of program execution on CPU registers and memory
   * Machine Level Programming
      * Write a program at the level of the examples in class and in Chapter 4
      * Understand programming details
   * Loader
      * What is a loader? What does it do?
      * Distinguish between RAM and ROM
      * Pep/9 memory architecture

* **Sample questions**
   * Show memory (static memory, stack and heap) for a given C program (also find output)
   * Converting among decimal, binary, and hex (signed and unsigned)
   * Logical/arithmetic operations on signed integers and effects on NZVC
   * The IEEE floating-point format (normalized, denormalized, and special values)
   * Find output and/or trace the execution of a given machine language program (Von Neumann tracing)
   * Write or modify a machine language program
