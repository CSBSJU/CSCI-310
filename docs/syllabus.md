## CSCI 310 Syllabus

### Preface [1](#ref1)
The CSCI 310 Syllabus serves to set forth what is expected during the semester
from the instructor and the students and to guide the behaviors of both parties.
More specifically, this syllabus delineates the responsibilities of students and
of the instructor for various tasks, including attendance, assignments,
examinations, and other requirements [2](#ref2). It also describes appropriate
procedures and course policies so that both students and the instructor know
ahead of time how certain potential occurrences&mdash;such as missing an exam or
submitting a late assignment&mdash;will be handled.

### Introduction
#### Purpose
CSCI 310 is an introduction to computer systems and architecture. Topics covered
include digital systems, machine level data representation, processor design,
assembly-level machine organization, memory systems, system control,
organization of operating systems, concurrency, and scheduling. The course will
focus on the layered architecture of computer systems in order to understand how
parts operate and cooperate to make an integrated machine. An important outcome
of this course is helping students become more informed programmers and computer
scientists. Students who complete the successfully successfully should expect to
be able to:
* identify and describe the key components of a computer system and how the
  components interact.
* explain the layered architecture of computer systems and how each layer
  relates to the others.
* explain how data and programs are represented inside computers.
* convert data from one representation to another.
* read, write, and debug assembly language and machine language programs.
* use logic equations, tables, and circuits to make the connection between
  software and hardware.
* explain the role of operating systems in managing storage, processes and
  programs.

#### Requirements
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

Students are REQUIRED to have access to the textbook, *Computer Systems* by J.
Stanley Warford. This course is based on the fifth edition of the book, thus, it
is RECOMMENDED that students acquire this edition.

#### Terminology
class meeting
  * A meeting scheduled during the time slot assigned to the course and during
    the university approved academic calendar for the relevant semester. Such
    meetings will normally take place in the assigned classroom, however, they
    MAY occur elsewhere.

excused absence
  * An absence from a scheduled class meeting with prior permission from the
    instructor. In the event that prior permission cannot be obtained, the
    student MUST notify the instructor of the reason for the absence as soon as
    reasonably possible. Reasons for missing a class meeting that qualify as
    excused include, but are not limited to, documented illness, death in your
    family, varsity athletic events (MUST NOT be practices), or other
    performances.

unexcused absence
  * An absence that is not excused.

original work
  * ...

closed book
  * ...

open note
  * ...

### Course policies
#### Attendance
Attendance is REQUIRED at all class meetings. Each unexcused absence MAY result
in a 1% reduction in the final grade for the course. Students who have more than
three unexcused absences MAY receive a failing grade for the course. Habitual
lateness in attending class meetings MAY be treated as unexcused absence.

#### Assignments
There will be several assignments during the semester including: readings,
in-class exercises, and take-home exercises. All of these assignments are
intended to be collaborative in nature and you are encouraged to work together
to understand the material and come up with solutions. However, all work
submitted for a grade MUST be your own original work. Late assignment
submissions MAY NOT be accepted.

#### Examinations
There will be three in-class exams and one cumulative final exam. All exams are
closed book/open note. All exam times are documented on the <a
href="https://csbsju.instructure.com/calendar">Canvas calendar <span class="fa
fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a> for this course; you are
responsible for keeping those times clear in your schedule. Students MAY be
allowed to make up missed exams in the case of an excused absence and at the
discretion of the instructor.

#### Emails / Outlook meeting invitations
I welcome emails and Outlook meeting invitations from students. However, please
use the following guidelines when sending either to me:
* start the subject line with CS310, CS 310, CSCI310, or CSCI 310
* provide a concise description in subject line
* use a salutation like, "Good Afternoon Prof. Iverson" or just "Prof. Iverson"
* use standard punctuation, capitalization, spelling, and grammar
If you fail to incorporate any of the above suggestions when corresponding with
me via email or meeting invitations, the I MAY NOT respond in a timely manner.

### Course evaluation
The final grade for the course will be based on the percentages shown below.

| Assignments    | 30% |
| In-class exams | 42% |
| Final exam     | 28% |

Grading is mainly based on the performance of each student compared to the class
as a whole. In general, the following guidelines are followed expect in certain
situations where the instructor sees a need for adjustments. A grade of F may be
given in situations of frequent unexcused absences, unsuccessful completion of
required work in a timely manner, or evident lack of understanding of core
material as illustrated by exam scores (e.g., failing all exams will result in
an F grade regardless of your total final score).

| A  | &ge;94% |
| AB | &ge;87% |
| B  | &ge;84% |
| BC | &ge;77% |
| C  | &ge;74% |
| CD | &ge;67% |
| D  | &ge;60% |
| F  | &lt;60% |

### Special accommodations
Students needing special accommodations or who have special needs are invited to
share this information with the instructor as early as possible.

### Scholastic conduct
Work must be completed in a manner consistent with the College of Saint
Benedict's & Saint John's University's codes for academic honesty. All outside
work and/or ideas used in any part of this course must be properly attributed;
all forms of plagiarism including — but not limited to — copying the ideas and
the written and/or spoken words of others and copying or annexing computer files
from other people are strictly prohibited. All acts of plagiarism, cheating, or
other academic misconduct are considered forms of academic dishonesty and are
strictly prohibited. Such instances of academic dishonesty will be reported to
the appropriate personnel and officials. Please refer to the most recent version
of the College of Saint Benedict & Saint John's University's Academic Catalog
for further relevant information and guidelines on this matter.

### Extra Help
This is a challenging course and exposes students to several new algorithmic
concepts and programming environments in a relatively short amount of time.
Students are strongly encouraged to seek help from the instructor on course
material when needed. Please contact me during office hours or by appointment to
discuss a homework problem or any aspect of the course.
