### Textbook
(*Required*) Computer Systems, Fifth Edition, J. Stanley Warford, published by
Jones and Bartlett Learning

### Course overview & objectives
This course is an introduction to computer systems and architecture. Topics
covered include digital systems, machine level data representation, processor
design, assembly-level machine organization, memory systems, system control,
organization of operating systems, concurrency, and scheduling. We will focus on
the layered architecture of computer systems in order to understand how parts
operate and cooperate to make an integrated machine. An important outcome of
this course is helping students become more informed programmers and computer
scientists. Students who complete the class successfully should be able to:
* Identify and describe the key components of a computer system and how the
  components interact. 
* Explain the layered architecture of computer systems and how each layer
  relates to the others. 
* Explain how data and programs are represented inside computers. 
* Convert data from one representation to another. 
* Read, write, and debug assembly language and machine language programs. 
* Use logic equations, tables, and circuits to make the connection between
  software and hardware. 
* Explain the role of operating systems in managing storage, processes and
  programs.

### Course requirements
**Attendance:** Class attendance is required. Each unexcused absence will result
in a 1% reduction in the final grade for the course. Students who miss more than
three classes without a documented excuse WILL RECEIVE A FAILING GRADE on the
course. Valid excuses include things like documented illness or death in your
family, prearranged absences because of varsity athletic events (NOT practices)
or other performances. Habitual lateness in attending classes will be treated as
absences. 

**Assignments:** There will be eight assignments during the semester, which
include assigned readings, in-class exercises, and take-home exercises. All of
these exercises are intended to be collaborative in nature and you are
encouraged to work together to come up with solutions. However, ALL work
submitted MUST be your own, you must produce your own, original version, of any
solution resulting from group work. If you require clarification on this point,
PLEASE ask. Late assignments submissions won't be accepted.

**Exams:** There will be three closed book/open note in-class exams and one
closed book/open note cumulative final exam. All exam times are documented on
your <a href="https://csbsju.instructure.com/calendar">Canvas calendar <span
class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>; you are responsible
for keeping those times clear in your schedule. Students will be allowed to make
up missed exams ONLY in the case of a documented emergency and at the discretion
of the instructor.

**Emails / Outlook meeting invitations:** I welcome emails and Outlook meeting
invitations from students. However, I do ask that you please use the following
guideline when sending either to me: start the subject line with CS310, CS 310,
CSCI310, or CSCI 310. This way, I can easily filter through my email and respond
to the important ones (from students) in a more timely manner.

### Course evaluation
The final grade for the course will be based on the percentages shown below.

| Assignments    | 30% |
| In-class exams | 42% |
| Final exam     | 28% |

Grading is mainly based on the performance of each student compared to the class
as a whole. In general, the following guidelines are followed expect in certain
situations where the instructor sees a need for adjustments. A grade of F may be
given in situations of frequent unexcused absences, unsuccessful completion of
required work in a timely manner, or evident lack of understanding of core
material as illustrated by exam scores (e.g., failing all exams will result in
an F grade regardless of your total final score).

| A  | &ge;94% |
| AB | &ge;87% |
| B  | &ge;84% |
| BC | &ge;77% |
| C  | &ge;74% |
| CD | &ge;67% |
| D  | &ge;60% |
| F  | &lt;60% |

### Special accommodations
Students needing special accommodations or who have special needs are invited to
share this information with the instructor as early as possible.

### Scholastic conduct
Work must be completed in a manner consistent with the College of Saint
Benedict's & Saint John's University's codes for academic honesty. All outside
work and/or ideas used in any part of this course must be properly attributed;
all forms of plagiarism including — but not limited to — copying the ideas and
the written and/or spoken words of others and copying or annexing computer files
from other people are strictly prohibited. All acts of plagiarism, cheating, or
other academic misconduct are considered forms of academic dishonesty and are
strictly prohibited. Such instances of academic dishonesty will be reported to
the appropriate personnel and officials. Please refer to the most recent version
of the College of Saint Benedict & Saint John's University's Academic Catalog
for further relevant information and guidelines on this matter.

### Extra Help
This is a challenging course and exposes students to several new algorithmic
concepts and programming environments in a relatively short amount of time.
Students are strongly encouraged to seek help from the instructor on course
material when needed. Please contact me during office hours or by appointment to
discuss a homework problem or any aspect of the course.
