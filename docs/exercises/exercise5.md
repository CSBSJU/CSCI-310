Pep/9 programs that do not adhere to the following WILL NOT be accepted or
graded:
* You are expected to do literal line-by-line translation. 
* Your assembly programs must include comments showing the corresponding C code
  that produces the each line of assembly code in your program. 
* In addition, I expect to see complete trace tags in your program (for global
  and stack tracers) such that I can see a complete picture of memory (static
  memory and stack) when using Pep/9's tracer.
* Finally, your program must be indented nicely to make it readable.
