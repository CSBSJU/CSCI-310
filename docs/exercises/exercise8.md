Solve the following problems

1. Chapter 10, problem 18
  * **NOTE** Figure 10.63 is on the following page

1. Chapter 10, problem 21
  * **NOTE** For XOR gates, you may need to replace them with their definitions:
    a XOR b = ab' + a'b

1. Use the _Logism_ circuit simulator to construct a circuit for the Boolean
   expression given below. Construct your circuit from the following gates only:
   AND, OR, NOT, NOR, NAND, and XOR. Use the circuit to complete the truth table
   using as many rows as needed.
  * **NOTE** Do not simplify the expression

   | A | B | C | (A'+B'C) XOR C' |
   | - | - | - | --------------- |
   |   |   |   |                 |
   |   |   |   |                 |
