### Course overview & objectives
Programming is at the core of computer science. Although most of the work done by computer scientists is not programming per se, that work is almost always under-girded by a knowledge of programming. It is essential that both programmers and computer scientists learn to program and to do so well. This course will provide students with the opportunity to learn the fundamental concepts and techniques of object-oriented computer programming. The object-oriented programming paradigm promises to improve the quality and reliability of computer software. In this course we will use the Java language, which is currently the most popular object-oriented language. Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to:
* write well-designed Java programs for small-scale problems,
* identify appropriate object classes for solving a given problem, and
* write good documentation for programs.

### Course requirements
Labs and lab attendance: There will be two scheduled 80-minute labs each cycle. In most cases, each lab will consist of prelab exercises to be completed before the scheduled lab time and selected exercises to be completed during the lab period. Students who complete the lab exercises during the lab period will demonstrate their completion to the instructor or TA before leaving the lab. Those in attendance who do not complete the exercises during the allotted lab time may still earn full credit by showing their solutions to their lab instructor or TA at the beginning of the next scheduled Tuesday lab (in effect, lab exercises are due on the Tuesday following the lab). Attendance at all labs is required and will be enforced. Each unexcused lab absence will result in the loss of points incurred by not completing the lab on time. (i.e., no credit can be earned for unexcused absences). A total of 3 unexcused lab absences will automatically result in a failing grade. Valid excuses include things like documented illness or death in your family, prearranged absences because of varsity athletic events (NOT practices) or other performances. Habitual lateness in attending labs will be treated as absences.

**Assignments:** There will be several assignments during the course, which include assigned readings, in-class exercises, and homework. While labs are intended to be collaborative in nature, unless noted otherwise, assignments are to be your own work — i.e., INDIVIDUAL WORK.

**Quizzes & exams:** There will be two closed book/note in-class exams, six closed book/note in-class quizzes, and three open book/note in-lab exams. I will drop the lowest in-class quiz grade. Under no circumstances will make-up quizzes be given. The syllabus lists all quiz and exam times; you are responsible for keeping those times clear in your schedule. There will be a comprehensive final closed book/open note exam. Students will be allowed to make up missed exams only in the case of a documented emergency and at the discretion of the instructor.

**Emails / Outlook meeting invitations:** I welcome emails and Outlook meeting invitations from students. However, I do ask that you please use the following guideline when sending either to me: start the subject line with CS160, CS 160, CSCI160, or CSCI 160. This way, I can easily filter through my email and respond to the important ones (from students) in a more timely manner.

### Special accomodations
Students needing special accommodations or who have special needs are invited to share this information with the instructor as early as possible.

### Scholastic conduct
Work must be completed in a manner consistent with the College of Saint Benedict's & Saint John's University's codes for academic honesty. All outside work and/or ideas used in any part of this course must be properly attributed; all forms of plagiarism including — but not limited to — copying the ideas and the written and/or spoken words of others and copying or annexing computer files from other people are strictly prohibited. All acts of plagiarism, cheating, or other academic misconduct are considered forms of academic dishonesty and are strictly prohibited. Such instances of academic dishonesty will be reported to the appropriate personnel and officials. Please refer to the most recent version of the College of Saint Benedict & Saint John's University's Academic Catalog for further relevant information and guidelines on this matter.
